    "We initially looked at several different methods of retreiving our data, including web scraping, pulling from premade datasets, and using various APIs. We quickly ruled out using premade datasets because we wanted to pull current stock information so our tool would be useful in analyzing stocks in the current market conditions. We also tried using web scraping originally on Yahoo Finance and Google Finance but ran into issues with both platforms. Yahoo Finance used to be a great solution for scraping data since it was formatted in HTML that was fast and easy to parse using libraries like Beautiful Soup. However, since last year, they changed their platform to make it very challenging to scrape information, requireing the use of an application like Selenium. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Google Finance is very sensitive to web scraping and only allows requests every 60 seconds, limiting the amount of stocks you can analyze and making the overall user experience unsatisfactory. We eneded up using Yahoo Finance's API, which provides quick and up-to-date data in a dataframe that is ready for analysis. This method allows us to retrieve the most current data so the user will always get the most current information for their analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are also using the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve real-time stock information when the market is open for additional information throughout the day. Finally, we are using the News API (NewsAPI.org) that will search for the top news articles for the given company (based on the stock ticker symbol) and display the top five articles for the user to read and gain better awareness of how the company is performing any pertinent inforamtion that may be affecting the stock price.

    "There are several key takeaways that can benefit future students who take on similar work. This first is how to leverage and implement the resources of available APIs, specifically Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and News. Using APIs ended up being significantly simpler and easily repeatable for different stocks, giving us more flexibility in the ways we could implement our engine. We were able to switch to a just-in-time model as opposed to downloading information about thousands of stocks at once. One of the biggest takeaways was the importance of error handling which proved essential to a smooth extraction process with the possibility of network issues or API failures. We had several instances when the APIs behaved in ways that we didn't expect or that may have crashed our program. An example was our real-time stock API calls. When we originally coded that portion, it was after the market closed, and therefore we kept having errors with the API giving us no information. We discovered the API didn't know how to handle giving information when the market was closed, so we had to code a function to check first before sending the API calls. Finally, we learned about fetching textual data from external news sources. This included parsing the JSON response to extract the relevant information for users to stay informed about their selected stock. This was handled in a different way than our other two data sources and we had to parse the information out in order to display it in a suitable manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we've learned a lot in this part of the project and are excited to continue developing. We have already built our frontend platform using Streamlit and have some base functionality set-up. We will continue to implement new features, add more buy/sell indicators, and improve our prediction accuracy."
